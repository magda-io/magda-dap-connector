As the observing time has been purchased this proposal (and the related PX501) does not require TAC grading.  The primary reason for submitting a proposal is to ensure an outreach statement and that the proposal is entered into OPAL for the data archive to access. The Chinese team have two time requests. The time scheduled for the first, relating to this proposal, will be allocated in blocks of 24 hours and the data will become available in the data archive with an 18 month embargo period.  The second type of time will be scheduled in shorter blocks and the data archived with a 10 year embargo.",

            "description": "With this proposal we ask time to continue our timing follow-up campaign of pulsars discovered with the MeerKAT telescope. Eighteen sources have been discovered in targeted observations of Fermi unidentified point sources, six in the Small Magellanic Cloud, 54 in Globular Clusters and 66 in a survey of the Galactic plane. A large fraction of the new discoveries are recycled pulsars (including at least one double neutron star system and several 'spider' binaries), or young pulsars. Timing observations have an essential role in exploiting the full potential of any pulsar discovery, allowing the precise measurement of rotational, astrometric and orbital parameters which, in turn, give us powerful tools to improve our understanding of the physics in extreme environments as well as of the population of neutron stars as a whole. The UWL receiver of the Parkes telescope is a sensitive, versatile instrument that is allowing us to successfully time these new sources, in the bright-end of TRAPUM discoveries. The UWL has also the unique advantage of allowing detailed studies of the eclipses of the so-called 'spider' pulsars, which make up about 1/3rd of the sources we aim at following-up with this project.",

Our current observations show that FRB~190520 is not only the most active FRB that can be observed with Parkes, but also shows extreme rotation measure (RM) variations and unique behavior at 2 to 3 GHz frequency. This makes UWL the ideal instrument to carry out in-depth studies of this repeating FRB. With this program, we expect to detect a large sample of bursts from FRB~190520, and in collaboration with the FAST telescope, we will study the local environment, emission properties, fluence distributions, and polarisation properties over an extremely wide bandwidth with high sensitivity.",

(2020; https://doi.org/10.25919/5f888e298da4f), which used a more precise but computationally expensive vector-tiling approach. Both were designed to support SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA; https://seea.un.org/ecosystem-accounting).\n\nThe accounting functions provided allow the user to calculate changes in extent and stocks between two time periods. These changes can be reported by a ‘change type’ image that will optionally track the reasons for additions and reductions. Stock accounts separately track changes due to reclassification in extent, supporting interpretation of changes over time. Time-series functions allow changes in extent, stocks, and flows to be quantified over time.  \n\nAdditional functionality is provided to support spatial analyses, such as generating Basic Spatial Unit (BSU) grids and calculating unique combinations of classes across multiple rasters.  \n",
